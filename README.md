# Simple Memory Game

## Description

This project was initially developed during a live coding session at Holberton School Toulouse (France), where I work as a Software Engineer and Educational Manager.

The goal was to create an interactive and beginner-friendly project to help students understand DOM manipulation, JavaScript event handling, and game logic implementation.

Watch the live coding sessions here:

- [First live coding session (FR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbYj49XVRIE)
- [Second live coding session (FR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt3c-V4D3YA)

Since the live session, I have made several improvements and additions, including:

- A sound effect plays when a pair is matched.
- A better card shuffle algorithm for improved randomness.
- Minor bug fixes and optimizations.

## Objectives

- Help beginners grasp how the DOM works.
- Demonstrate event handling in JavaScript.
- Show how to dynamically manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Build an interactive game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    - Open your preferred Terminal.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fchavonet/web-simple_memory_game.git
```

2. Open the cloned repository.

### Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Click on a card to reveal its symbol.

3. Try to find its matching pair.

4. If the two selected cards match, they remain flipped.

5. If they donâ€™t match, they flip back after a short delay.

6. Continue until all pairs are found.

7. A sound effect will play when a pair is matched.

8. Once all pairs are found, a message will display the number of attempts.

## What's Next?

- Improve the game UI (replace alerts with a custom one).
- Save best scores using local storage.
- Make the game mobile-friendly.

## Thanks

- Thank you to everyone who participated in the live coding sessions!
- A special thanks to Pierre for always giving me feedback on the sound quality and to Yoann for spotting multiple bugs and even finding ways to cheat ðŸ˜‰!
